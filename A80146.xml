            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr to thee alone, do I commend this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, who alone, art able to judge of ſpirituall things; for, the ſpiritual man judgeth all things. I have here in this Treatiſe, preſented unto publike view, ſome principles of Truth. Although I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſome particulars herein, may ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange at the firſt ſight; yet I queſtion not, but the ſame Spirit of Truth, which is given forth from the Father, through the Son, to the Saints, wil by degrees ſo gather Vs up into the myſterie of Truth, that we ſhall all ſpeak the ſame thing, from our walking in the ſame light, and acting in the ſame power. I have in this place only three words to mind thee of, as a preparative to what thou ſhalt reade in this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the diſcovery of the firſt man, <hi>Adam,</hi> to be but a humane man: a man, indued, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perfections; is not a ſtrange, but a glorious truth, and meet to be known: for, the knowledge of this one particular, leades us to the knowledge of the Creatures nothingneſſe; the wiſdome, power, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. of the Creature, it is all but of the Earth, and that it is the proper work of Chriſt, the ſecond man, to ruine and deſtroy in thee, all, that is of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> even thoſe reliques that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
<pb facs="tcp:169419:2"/> that wiſdome is turned into folly, that ſtrength, into weakneſſe; that righteouſneſſe &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; into meer filthineſſe and pollution: ſo that Chriſt doth not where he comes in mercy, reſtore man to his firſt condition, as it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes thoſe principles, as we are Chriſtians, and ſo creates a new man in us, which, after God, is created in righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe, <hi>Epheſ. 4.24.</hi> and he that is in Chriſt, is a new creature, <hi>2 Cor. 5.17.</hi> All old things are done away, behold all things are become new; and as is the earthly, ſuch are they who are earthly; as is the heavenly (that is, Chriſt) ſuch are they who are heavenly, <hi>1 Cor. 15.48.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the glory of a Chriſtians life is in the knowledge of Chriſt, living in him: ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 2.20.</hi> I am crucified with Chriſt; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, I live, yet n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I, but Christ liveth in me, and Chriſt in you: the hope of glory, is the great myſtery of the Goſpel for the Saints to know, <hi>Col. 1.27.</hi> that is, not to live wholly on the eying of what Chriſt hath d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne, without us, for us; but likewiſe to be able to experience the life of that Christ in us, being made partaker of the ſame ſpirit, of the ſame Annointings, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the knowledge of Antichriſt, is the knowledge of a myſtery, I mean, a myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:169419:3"/> likewiſe is the myſterie of Iniquitie hid from them that periſh.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, and in a word; My deſire is, that, what truth thou findeſt here written, thy ſpirit may bee made one, in, and with the ſame truth; that ſo, both thou and I, may have communion &amp; fellowſhip with the Spirit in the ſame truth; and what informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or conſolation thy ſpirit findeth from what is truth, (letting any Creature-weakneſſe, thou findeſt, paſſe) let God have the glory, and ſo, thy poore friend in the unity of truth, and fellowſhip of the Goſpel, hath his utmoſt end.</p>

               <p>THE cauſe or ground of mans falling from his firſt eſtate, may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under three particulars. 1. The muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his condition. 2. The temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sathan. 3. His diſobedient acting, contrary to the revealed minde of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the mutability of his condition, he was created of God, though upright and perfect, yet ſubject to a change: the power being put in his own hand; the firſt opportunity preſented him, he falles, and (indeed) it could not be otherwiſe, he could not ſtand of himſelfe unleſſe he had bin God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If the mutability of <hi>Adams</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was the firſt cauſe of his fall; then it ſeemes that God himſelfe was the firſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169419:10"/> cauſe of ſin, if God made man at firſt in that condition that he might fall, nay, that he could not but fall, then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeemes to be the firſt cauſe both of ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that the firſt cauſe of all things is in God, he was before all things, he created all things, and all things live and move in him, and by him, and he worketh all things after the councel of his own will, yet 2. although he be the firſt cauſe of all created things, yet not of any evill that through degeneration, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans temptation, flowes from thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: man in his firſt creation was good, but through his degenerating from it, he became evill; ſo that the evill was not in God, but in man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God having made man in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, man of himſelfe freely, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rebelliouſly falling, God bringeth about his everlaſting purpoſe in rayſing up ſome in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and everlaſting union with himſelfe, where they ſhall be for ever preſerved, and be kept by the power of God from falling: and others; (to wit) all unbelievers left in the nature of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> and there he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169419:10"/> manifeſteth. 2. the cauſe of mans falling, his juſtice, the temptation of Sathan, or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo he is called <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. note firſt what Sathan is that tempts and overcomes man, 1. he is a ſpirituall enemy to mankinde, as appeares not onely by his deluding of our firſt parents, but the whole Scripture diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers as much, he goeth about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure, no ſooner was man created of God, but he ſeekes preſently to devoure him, God having given forth Chriſt as a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he preſently ſets upon him likewiſe, to devoure him, if he could, and ſo in him all mankinde for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Thus you ſee Sathan is an adverſary to mankinde, 2. Sathan or the divells, or the falne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Angels that fell ſeeme to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Iude</hi> 6. the Angels that kept not their firſt eſtate are reſerved in everlaſting Chaines under darkneſſe, unto the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day, ſo there are many devills or evill ſpirits, as appeares by the man poſſeſſed by the Divell, when Chriſt asked his name, he anſwers my name is Legion, for we are many, 3. He is a lying and deluding Spirit, that oft times tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes himſelfe into an Angel of light:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169419:11"/> hence it comes to paſſe, that he ſo deludes all the Sons and Daughters of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they looke upon all his workes of darkneſſe with delight and pleaſure: and oft times it comes to paſſe, that he ſo farre transformes himſelfe into a ſon of light, that he delivers ſoules under the name of Chriſt, and when nothing leſſe then the name of a Chriſtian will ſerve, he will be the Chriſt, or rather the Antichriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſoules, hence it comes to paſſe, when down-right papacy will not ſerve, he will turne himſelfe into a prelaticall ſhape, rather then looſe his Rule and credit amongſt the ſons of men: if once prelacy grow out of date, he can change himſelfe into other ſhapes; if ten hornes be too heavy to be borne, he will be content to weare but two like a Lambe, rather then none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Why is Sathan called a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe in his firſt prevailing with the woman he did either make uſe of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. who was a ſubtill creature, and ſo comes in the Serpent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woman, or elſe ſecondly transforms himſelfe in the ſhape and forme of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169419:11"/> Serpent, and ſo repreſents himſelfe unto the woman, and ſo from hence received the denomination of a Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. If the firſt, then learn, that Satan uſually makes uſe of the wiſeſt and ſubtileſt creatures to bring to paſſe his will in or by them: If the ſecond, learn that Satan can transform himſelfe into any ſhape or form to delude and deceive ſoules.</p>
               <p>A third cauſe of Mans fall, was, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient acting, contrary to the mind of God, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Adam</hi> eateth thereof, and dieth: diſobedience was the cauſe of mans fall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>

He delivers from wrath in a two-fold conſideration: Firſt, from that wrath and juſtice of God, gone forth in a righteous law; it being broken, wrath is gone forth upon all, becauſe God is Truth, and ſo in the letter, wrath is gone forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all through <hi>Adams</hi> trnaſgreſſion, and ſo all unbelievers in that ſenſe, are under wrath, and there remain eternally, if not delivered, <hi>John</hi> 3. laſt. 2. They are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from wrath with relation to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion: Never any ſoul comes ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſt, but he firſt makes him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of an eſtate of wrath, and ſo every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever may truly ſay, <hi>They were once chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath,</hi> that is, in an eſtate of wrath, under the Law of Tranſgreſſion, and ſo are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169419:17"/> delivered from wrath to come; becauſe if God had not from everlaſting received them into the number of thoſe written in heaven, they muſt likewiſe have endured wrath to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He purchaſed his Church with his blood, and ſo ſalvation for them, under two conſiderations: 1. He purchaſed his Church from the Law of Tranſgreſſion, God having ſaid, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye.</hi> Man eates, and ſo ſhould have died eternally, had not God provided ſuch a remedy; therefore he gives his Son to purchaſe Man from that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. He purchaſeth His with his blood, from wrath and condemnation in their own apprehenſions; Man being ſenſible of his loſt condition, muſt have ſomething to ſatisfie his conſcience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likewiſe the Father gives Chriſt, and in both theſe, not as the firſt and moving cauſe of any thing in God; but God out of his love gives forth his Son to effect that work. As if a man indebted for more than he is ever able to pay, the Creditor having vowed ſatisfaction, the debter is caſt down and troubled exceedingly: the creditor to ſatisfie both his own word, and the mind
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169419:17"/> of the debter: ſends forth his Sonne, and fully inables him to pay the debt; he brings along the debter with him, payes the debt, cancells the bands and ſets him free, and thus it was with the Father, man had ſinned, God had ſaid, in the day thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt dye, this debt of death muſt be diſcharged: the Father, that he might be juſt, and yet a juſtifier, and that the conſcience of falne man whom he loved might be ſatisfied, he gives or ſends forth his Sonne, he payes the debt, and ſo ſatisfies the word of the Father, and the conſcience of the ſinner, and ſo (indeed) is not eſſentially the procuring cauſe of love, but rather an effect of love to ſatisfie both the word of the Father, and the conſcience of the ſinner, and this was Gods way from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, through which he intended to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelfe to his people.</p>

               <p>But 2. Faith juſtifies, as it receives Chriſt and applyes him as its juſtification: ſo that it is ſaid to juſtifie, becauſe it ſatisfies and quiets the ſoule in Chriſt who is its juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. he that worketh not,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169419:21"/> 
                  <hi>but beleeveth on him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is counted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Note two words: 1. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on him that juſtifieth,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt; all that beleeve, are juſtified, by him,</hi> Acts 13.39. So it is Chriſt that juſtifieth; faith onely ownes that juſtification held forth in Chriſt. 2. word, <hi>His faith is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, either firſt, God never declares a man righteous and juſt, untill he give him faith to enjoy his righteouſneſſe in Chriſt: or elſe ſecondly, his faith is counted or called his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe he never till then enjoyed his righteouſneſſe. And ſo that when I ſay, or the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Faith juſtifieth:</hi> that is, faith receives and ownes the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of God in Chriſt declared, and ſo the ſoule by it lives in the enjoyment of juſtification and freedome from ſin.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> property or effect of faith, is, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 51. <hi>Being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith, we have peace with God, chap.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with joy and peace through beleeving.</hi> This is one glorious effect, that thoſe who once were a-farre off, ſhould now bee made nigh by the blood of Chriſt, and be brought
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169419:22"/> into the enjoyment of it by beleeving.</p>
               <p>The third effect is, it puts the ſoul into the poſſeſſion of the love of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. <hi>We have known &amp; beleeved the love that God hath to us: and God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him:</hi> It acts the ſoule above it ſelfe, and cauſeth it to dwell in God, and ſo to dwell in his love, and this is an exceeding glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effect, and that which, in the fourth place, fills the ſoule with joy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> What can a ſoule deſire more, than to dwell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the love of God; When the ſoule is ſatisfied from its union with God, and its dwelling in God, that all the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations and makings forth of God, is love unto it! And thus it dwels in love, and from hence is filled with joy, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſoule alwayes to dwell at the right hand of God, where is <hi>joy and pleaſure for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, in a word to conclude, the effect of faith is ſuch, as that God by it workes up the ſoule to an internall and externall conformity to Chriſt in ſome meaſure, with a ſpirituall and eternall conformity in perfection in another world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169419:22"/> 1, 2.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. where faith ſhall ceaſe, and love and unity be made perfect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</p>

It was a part of the prayer of Chriſt, who was heard in all things he asked, <hi>That they alſo may be one in us.</hi> Now the union of the Father, Sonne and Saints, may be conſidered, either as firſt a union of ſpirits; The Lord powred down of his Spirit abundantly upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, according to that glorious propheſie, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.2 <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall rest upon him, the ſpirit of Wiſdome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,

Hence it is, that thoſe who are taught of God, deſpiſe the worlds wiſdome, and are content to be fooles to the world, and in the worlds eyes, that they may be wiſe in God. Hence it is likewiſe, that ſo many Ignorants, in the wiſe and learned mens account, are made partakers of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the myſtery; which (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) according to the Word of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27.

               <p>Secondly, in the Spirit, the Saints are made the righteouſneſſe of God; that is, God, now as in Chriſt, dwells and acts in his Saints by his Spirit, writes his law in their hearts, makes them partakers of his own nature, and ſo goes on in fulfilling his own righteouſneſſe in them: For, the righteouſneſſe of the law in the Spirit is fulfilled in us, aſwell as the law in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us who walke not after the fleſh; that is, after the law in the letter, but after the Spirit of Chriſt who dwells in us, and acts according to its own pleaſure, and ſo by degrees drawes up the ſpirits of his people to himſelf, untill at laſt, they are ſwallowed up in the fulneſſe of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God in the Spirit, and bee made wholly and for ever one in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.2.

What is the reaſon Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors content themſelues to be ſo low, ſo carnall in their minds; but becauſe they were never acquainted with, nor enjoyed higher things? but the Apoſtle who had ſeen and taſted of that glory, forgets all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and preſſeth forward; if ſo be, that he

Certainly, that ſoule who hath once taſted how good, how gracious the Lord is, in the ſpirit, can never be ſatisfied with the knowledge of him, in the Letter. 3 The knowledge of this ſpiritual union with God produceth an acting more in and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit of God: How doth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſet it ſelf a-work, and acts it ſelf even in the Letter of the Goſpel, aſwel as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Letter of the Law, for want of knowledge of the union in the ſpiritual power of the Lord! although without Chriſt, that is not being acted by Chriſt; we can do nothing; the Creature being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with that ſpiritual myſtical u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, acts himſelf in the things of God. 4 The knowledge of this ſpiritual union with God, produceth the killing &amp; crucifying of that earthly part: nothing kils and deſtroyes the fleſh, but the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the ſpirit. Oh! how would the ſoule many times be content to undergoe any thing, ſo it might bee rid of pride and ſelfe, and thoſe fleſhly corruptions; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169419:32"/> why? it is the growing up in the ſpirit, that deſtroyes the fleſh: the more you live in and after the ſpirit, the leſſe, after the fleſh. 5 It is that will help us to know Chriſt and the Saints, more in and after the ſpirit, and leſſe after the fleſh, and ſo wil produce a more ſpiritual communion amongſt all the ſpiritual Saints of Jeſus. 6 And laſtly, it is that wil make the thoughts of a change exceeding ſweet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoule lives in expectation of a glorious freedome from ſinne and ſorrow, and a full perfection of ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory, therefore it can be contented to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all, where it ſhal for ever live in the continual admiration of, and glorying in the ſpiritual enjoyment of God, whoſe work ſhal bee everlaſtingly and fully to enjoy, and freely to ſing prayſes unto the Lord.</p>

               <p>THE Law in the Letter is a rule of life anſwerable to thoſe moral principles of nature left in man ſince his fall; the ſubſtance of which Law was written in the heart of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Verbal word; <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> Man having yet the principles of that Law remaining in him. God having by the promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah given a farther being to Mankind in the world; hee gives forth the righteous Law more at large in the Letter, that ſo his Creatures might have a rule in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to walk by, and likewiſe might bee the more ſenſible of the loſſe of both; that principle and power they had once in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> given unto them; and likewiſe with it, gives, though not the ſame power, yet the ſame promiſe of external life in the Land, God gives them. 2 The Law was that by which ſin came: that is, by which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169419:33"/> ſin became ſinfull: For it is true, had not God given a Law; yet' man would have been acting contrary to the pure mind of God: therefore he giues a Law, that ſinne might become out or meaſure ſinful, and it was added, becauſe or tranſgreſſion; for where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion: For, by the Law, was the knowledge of ſinne, and ſo it was an Adminiſtration of death, both in the hands of <hi>Adam,</hi> as wel as <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Law in the Letter was an Image or Character of that ſpiritual righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, God intended to bring in by Jeſus Chriſt: Aas <hi>Adam</hi> was an Image of that ſpiritual perfection God intended to make his partakers of in the ſpirit by Chriſt; So this Law in the Letter was a rule anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that moral principle of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in <hi>Adam,</hi> and a Character likewiſe of that ſpiritual righteouſneſſe that every beleever attaines in Chriſt: the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law in the Letter, was not that beleevers enjoy in Chriſt; but that righteouſneſſe <hi>Adam</hi> injoyed in his ſtate of innocencie. It was not the righteouſneſſe of God; but a Character of that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, holineſſe, and purity, that all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169419:33"/> are made partakers of in the ſpirit: It was not that righteouſneſſe, by which God intended to give life and glory eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; but ſuch a righteouſneſſe which had external promiſes annexed unto it: For, if there had been a Law given, that could haue given life; then righteouſneſſe had been by the Law. Wherefore, I coclude, that the Law in the Letter was but a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the ſpiritual righteouſneſſe of God, which is the life of the Saints, and that by which God never intended to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie any to Eternity: For, the Law in the Letter killeth, not juſtifieth; but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it giveth life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. The Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Adam</hi> in th Letter, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was he Miniſter of the Law in the Letter, but, Chriſt is the Miniſter of the Law in the ſpirit: Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith himſelfe, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up, unto you, like unto me, him ſhall you heare in all things, Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that Chriſt and the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel, was included
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169419:34"/> in the Law. There was a literall or externall righteouſneſſe expreſſed in the letter, to which were externall promiſes annexed: but there was a ſpirituall and internall righteouſneſſe included, which, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers were made partakers of, which was a righteouſneſſe brought in by Chriſt, and obtained by faith, which is the law in the Spirit, or that ſpirituall righteouſneſſe of God, that beleevers are made partakers of, which is the ſecond thing propounded, what the Law in the ſpirit, is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Law in the ſpirit, or the ſpirituall righteouſneſſe contained in the Law, as you have already heard, is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, which every beleever is made partaker of. Note theſe two words for the more full clearing of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there was a ſpirituall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe included myſtically in the letter of the Law, which none ever ſaw into; but thoſe ſpiritually enlightned. <hi>Paul</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>For we know that the Law is ſpirituall, but I am carnall.</hi> The Law in the Letter was not ſpirituall: For the ſame Apoſtle could ſay, that he walked concerning the righteouſneſſe of the Law in the letter, <hi>blameleſſe, Phil.</hi> 3. yet he call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:169419:35"/> it, <hi>a fleſhly walking: If any man had cauſe of glorying in the fleſh, I much more.</hi> And he ſaith, he <hi>was alive once without the Law; but when the commandement came, ſin revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I dyed, Rom.</hi> 7.9. alive, without the Law, in the ſpirit; for, he was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, in the letter: by that it was he judged himſelfe to be alive; he walked concerning that, blameleſſe; but when the commandement came, that is, when the ſpiritual righteouſneſſe of the law was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, which was no leſſe than the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God; then he ſaw how ſhort he came of that righteouſneſſe: hee was yet but in the letter, in the fleſh, and not in the ſpirit; <hi>Then ſin revived, I died</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Law in the ſpirit, is that ſpirituall righteouſneſſe of God, that beleevers are made partakers of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life.</hi> The letter killeth, the letter requireth an exact and perfect obedience, which none was able to performe; and ſo, the very let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law did kill. So at firſt it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity; and ſo it killed the Jewes, being given forth in a more large way; for it was <hi>the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death: but the Spirit giveth life,</hi> viz.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169419:35"/> the Lord Jeſus, the ſpirit and ſubſtance of the Law, both morall and ceremoniall; for <hi>the firſt man was made a living ſoule,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a morall righteouſneſſe; <hi>the ſecond was made a quickning ſpirit,</hi> to give life to thoſe, dead in the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> And as the Father hath life in himſelfe; ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelfe, and hee quickneth whom he will, <hi>John</hi> 5. The Law, in the letter killeth; the law, in the ſpirit, quickneth: Therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I came not to deſtroy, but to ſave, Iohn</hi> 12.47.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what the Goſpel is, There is likewiſe the Goſpel in the Letter, and the Goſpel in the Spirit: The Goſpel in the letter; which properly doth ſignifie <hi>glad tidings:</hi> and this Goſpel is to goe forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all; but none are made partakers of it in the ſpirit, but beleevers: All are made partakers of it in the letter, it is glad tidings to all; and that in a double ſenſe: 1. It is glad tidings to all; for, all have a Being by it: it is that which hath made peace for all; an external peace, in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that preſent curſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is that wherein internal and external peace is held forth and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all, which is glad tidings; none are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169419:36"/> exempted in the letter, til they exempt themſelves through unbelief, and ſo judge themſelves unworthy of eternal life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is the Goſpel in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter likewiſe, as it is a Goſpel of ſpiritual peace and reconciliation: And thus every beleever receives it, firſt in the letter, through the power of the ſpirit, and this is Chriſt in the fleſh, dying upon the croſſe, taking away the condemnation of the Law in the letter. And this is that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the guilt of ſin in the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; a viſible ſatisfaction for a literal tranſgreſſion: This was Gods way to take away ſin, and this is the firſt diſcovery God makes of himſelf to a ſinner, becauſe he is pleaſed to conform himſelfe to that way that might beſt ſuit with our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo by degrees to draw us up more in the ſpirit unto himſelfe, and this is the Goſpel in the letter, anſwering the Law in the letter, and the conſcience trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled through the ſenſe of ſin, which is the firſt knowledge of Chriſt; and is (indeed) but a knowledge after the fleſh, and ſo is in the eſteem of the Apoſtle, but a carnal knowledge (that is) being compared to the ſpiritual knowledge: therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169419:36"/> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>I cannot write unto you as unto ſpirituall, but as unto carnall, even as unto Babes in Chriſt.</hi> Note, I doe not ſpeak thus of the knowledge of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, and the application of it, taking away the guilt of ſin, as a low and ſlight thing in it ſelfe: For firſt, it is Gods way to ſatisfie ſinning ſouls, and ſo none ever partake of mercy, but by this way. Secondly, it is that, being wrought by the ſpirit of Chriſt, brings ſouls under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of children, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.12. Thirdly, it is that by which the ſoule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes much joy and peace; who ſo hath obtained it from the Lord, hath obtained a good degree, and much boldneſſe in the ſpirit. Yet fourthly, God uſually by this way, brings ſouls up into a ſpiritual union with himſelfe, and in compariſon of the ſouls enjoying of God in Chriſt, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls it <hi>a carnall or fleſhly knowledge:</hi> and doubtleſſe many may attain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel in the letter, and may own a dying Chriſt upon the Croſſe, and yet be but a humane faith, a literal Goſpel, and never truly known in the Spirit. But thoſe who are brought to the knowledge of and beleeving in, Chriſt dying upon the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169419:37"/> Croſſe, by the ſaving work of the ſpirit, ſhall grow up in the more ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Goſpel in the ſpirit is the righteouſneſſe of God imparted in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the beleever: it is the making of the beleever partaker of the ſame nature, of the ſame ſpirit that was in Chriſt Jeſus. The Goſpel in the ſpirit is the ſame as the Law in the ſpirit, and repreſents the ſpiritual righteouſneſſe of God, with which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to cloath his people, and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. As there was a literal tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law; ſo there is a Goſpel in the letter, to anſwer it; &amp; a Chriſt dying upon the croſſe. As there was a ſpirituall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe included in the Law; ſo likewiſe is there a ſpiritual righteouſnes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that is, in Chriſt, they are both in Chriſt: the former righteouſnes is the knowledge of Chriſt, without, as dying, and ſatisfying: the ſecond, is the knowledge of Chriſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually formed in us, which is here done in part, and we ſhall in the concluſion bee wholly changed, and ſwallowed up in that ſpirituall righteouſneſſe. And indeed here lies the great myſtery of the Goſpel in theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:169419:37"/>1 God in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 Chriſt ſpiritually in the Saints, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1.27. 3 That ful ſpiritual change into the ſpirit at the laſt day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.15. So that this is the glad tydings of the Goſpel in the ſpirit, not only that wee are made one with God, but likewiſe that wee are made one in God; he dwelleth in us, &amp; we dwell in him, and wee now ſerve no longer in the oldneſſe of the letter; that is, with our old nature, in the old letter given forth to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the old end, the obtaining of righteouſneſſe, but in the newneſſe of the Spirit; that is, the renewed mind by the ſpirit, to a new letter written in the heart, to a new end, to glorifie the name of our Lord Jeſus, and to declare our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to him in the ſpirit. That this is in the Goſpel, in the ſpirit, which the Lord Jeſus brings up his unto by degrees; the Scriptures in the ſpiritual underſtanding will declare, not onely for confirmation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. In the firſt, the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Henceforth we know no man after the fleſh; yea, though wee have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth we know him no more after the fleſh.</hi> Note firſt there is a knowledge of Chriſt after the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169419:38"/> fleſh, even of the Saints; <hi>Although we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet know we him no more.</hi> Why? verſ. 17. <hi>If any man bee in Chriſt, he is a new Creature,</hi> Chriſt is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in him after the ſpirit, and hee comes now to know a ſpiritual Chriſt within him, as well as a fleſhly Chriſt without him. The ſecond Scripture ſaith, <hi>Wee have boldneſſe to enter into the holyeſt, by the blood of Chriſt, by a new and a living way, that he hath conſecrated for us through the veil;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>his fleſh:</hi> where likewiſe note, that the bloud of Chriſt is but the way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holyeſt, and the fleſh of Chriſt is the veil, through which we enter into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt; that is, into the ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injoyment of God. We come firſt to the fleſh, and ſecondly to the ſpirit, the fleſh being the way to the ſpiritual enjoyment of him, where Chriſt is entred already in the perfection, and will in concluſion draw all his ſpiritual Ones after him unto the ſame perfection, into the ſame glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If this be the Goſpel in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to know Chriſt no more after the fleſh, and to live in the ſpirit, to look upon Chriſt as the way, in the fleſh, into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or holyeſt where he is; then what need
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169419:38"/> of faith ſo much ſpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith, and</hi> We <hi>are juſtifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Faith may be acted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Chriſt dying upon the Croſſe, but in Chriſt living in the ſoule: that is, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that Chriſt is ſpiritually formed in me; as wel as that he hath dyed for me, that I am juſtified in the ſpirit, as wel as in the fleſh; faith hath the ſame object in the ſpirit, as in the fleſh, to beleeve that Chriſt lives ſpiritually in the ſoule, and that it ſhal bee ſwallowed up in the concluſion wholly in the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There may be often occaſions to make uſe of faith likewiſe, while we are in this body of fleſh: although the ſoule obtaines a good degree of the enjoyment of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from, and in God; yet there wil bee through the preſence of corruption ſome ſtirre and trouble: and this God in his wiſdome permits for ends beſt known to himſelfe. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who lived exceeding highly in the ſpirit, ſometimes in the third heaven, that is, in the higheſt diſcovery of God; yet he meets with a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, that was, ſome ſtrong luſt in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169419:39"/> the fleſh, that might cauſe him to look down again: And the reaſon he renders, <hi>Leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. For, the truth is; if God ſhould cauſe any one to live alwayes in heaven, that is, above all luſts and corruptions, in the higheſt diſcovery and enjoyment of God; he would be ready to be lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure.

               <p n="3">3. There is a continuall uſe of Faith, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169419:39"/> that of the moſt ſpirituall Chriſtian, with relation to the perfection of our eternall injoyments: for, the Saints do not onely injoy a oneneſſe with God here, and from hence much ſpirituall and internall glory; but by faith, believes, and hope, expects that perfection of glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein it ſhall be perfectly made like unto Chriſt, <hi>when this vile body ſhall be changed, and made like unto his glorious body,</hi> which at preſent ſo acts it ſelfe even in the Saints, which prevents them even of that perfection of glory, which they by faith expect when the change comes: <hi>when Corruption, ſhall put one Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Mortall, ſhall put on Immortality: When this naturall body ſhall become ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall;</hi> then ſhall be fully injoyed what hath been by faith believed, and by hope expected; and of this hath the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Chriſtian a taſte, in the ſpirituall injoyment of God here, although not as then ſo fully ſwallowed up in that glory.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The difference is both in the Letter, and in the Spirit, the Goſpel in the Spirit is the ſubſtance of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſpiritually included in the Law,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169419:40"/> as the Type, Image, or Character of that ſpirituall ſubſtance the Saynts are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of. Hence, it is often called the Law in the Spirit, the Letter killeth, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth life, and I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. that is, I through the Law of the Spirit, that is, the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt, am dead to the Law in the Letter, that I might live unto God in the Spirit, and not to the Law and ſelfe in the Letter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Difference is in the Letter of the Law, and ſo of the Goſpel, and this is glorious, for the letter of the law required a righteouſneſſe that was broken, death ceiſeth on all by that meanes, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the Letter holds forth a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt, fulfilling the Letter of the Law ſo that what righteouſneſſe is in the Law required, is obtained by Chriſt, and every beleever is made partaker of it, and ſo the difference is, 1.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169419:43"/> deſired at preſent, that Saints Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion might flow more from their union in the ſpirit, and not altogether from the union in the letter: this is the glorious Church of Chriſt; and the knowledge of it in the ſpirit, will cauſe Saints to own each other more in the ſpirit. 2. The Church of Chriſt may be conſidered more particular, or a particular body, or company of Saints in the viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, walking in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Ordinances; taking particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care of each other, and building up each other in the faith: &amp; of this Church we ſhall reade, frequent in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; and this Church is likewiſe called the body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. and it is not to be queſtioned, but that this practiſe is very commendable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Saints: and the knowledge of God in the Spirit, and of Saints in the Spirit, will not breake or leſſen the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of particular Churches; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, and make it to be more ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: for, queſtionles that which tends to the breach of communion and fellowſhips a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Saints, is not of God, for God is love, &amp; they who dwell in God, dwell in

Oh that the Lord would helpe us to beare with each other in ſuch things! why cannot Saints in matters of difference beare with each other according to the Apoſtles rule? ſeeing he that obſerveth a day, obſerveth it to the Lord; and he that obſerveth not a day, obſerveth it not to the Lord, and both give God thankes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>A fourth ſort there are who put Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances upon thoſe not capable of them without any word at all in the letters and this is the moſt carnal work of all, and ſavours much of the earth, and of an old Teſtament-ſpirit, from whence uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the ground is brought, and it were

                     </gap>his mountaine,</hi> (that is, in the Church) <hi>the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the veile ſpread over all Nations.</hi> Such hath been the ignorance that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread all People, and Nations, through the ſpiritual operation of the man of ſinne; that, the myſtery of the Goſpell hath been
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169419:48"/> hid, as it were, from us, and ſealed up even with ſeven ſeales, a perfection of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that none was found worthy to open it: Humane Arts, and Creature-wiſdome being ſet a-work, did but ſo much the more darken it, and caſt a veile upon it, till at laſt the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> begins to open it himſelfe, and will unſeale it by degrees, and cauſe the veile to vaniſh away, to the great glory of his ſpirituall Ones; but to the great terror of all humaniſts, who were left without this ſpirituall knowledge of Chriſt. See the further confirmation of this truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</hi> As ignorance hath, as a veil, been ſpread over all Nations: ſo ſhall the knowledge of the Lord goe forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly throughout all Nations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17, 19, 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that which ſhall make for the Churches ſpirituall glory, ſhall be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a full freedome from the guilt of ſinne; that which much troubles many a pretious ſoule: and it was that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was freed from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of bondage to feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but the ſpirit of adoption whereby we

And from henceforth they ſhall not ſay, <hi>I am ſicke, and the voyce of crying and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſhall be no more heard in her, for, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things are paſſed away: there ſhall bee no more ſin nor ſorrow, but everlaſting joy ſhall be upon her head and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall paſſe away, Iſai.</hi> 35.10.</p>
               <p>A third thing that ſhall make for the Saints ſpiritual glory, is the knowledge of, and enjoyment of, a ſpiritual Oneneſſe with God in Chriſt, and each with other: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be a glorious ſpiritual truth: yet it is that the Saints have lived excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhort in the knowledge of it; the knowledge and enjoyment of it will be exceeding glorious to the ſpiritual Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. What this union is, and wherein it conſiſts, I referre it to what hath been ſaid formerly in the glorious condition of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169419:49"/> perſons in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> above the firſt.</p>
               <p>A fourth thing that will make for the Saints ſpirituall glory, is, a living above creatures and things, in the ſpirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, whom to enjoy is life; when all things below, ſhal bee nothing; when the ſoule ſhall be content to ſuffer the loſſe of all things, that Chriſt may bee <hi>all, and in all;</hi> the glorious Lord will bee unto us a place of broad rivers &amp; ſtreams, wherin ſhal go no Gally with Oares, nor ſhall gallant Ships paſſe thereby, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.24. no need of rowing in creatures or things, no need of gallant ſhips, of any thing to carry the ſoul up unto God, or to bring God in Chriſt down to the ſoule; but the glorious Lord will be <hi>all, and in all,</hi> and the ſpiritual Chriſtian ſhal live in the enjoyment of him. verſe 23. Then ſhal the tacklings be forſaken, or looſed, they could not ſtrengthen their Maſt, they ſhal not be able, who deſire it, to ſaile any further or longer in ordinances, duties, creatures; but the great ſpoyle ſhal be divided, and the lame take the ſpoyle, the lame contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ones, they are the people that are like to enjoy this ſpiritual glory.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:169419:49"/>
               <p>A fifth thing that wil make for the Saints ſpiritual glory, is a ſpiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conformity unto God: they ſhal live up in the ſpirit, and walk after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Chriſt will manifeſt himſelfe ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them: the light of the Moone ſhall be as the light of the Sunne; and the light of the Sunne ſhall be ſeuen-fold as the light of ſeven dayes; the light of the Moon, that is, of the Church, ſhal be as the light of the ſun, <hi>that is,</hi> Chriſt the ſonne of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who is both a Sun and a ſhield; and the light of the ſunne ſhall be ſeven-fold, <hi>that is,</hi> Chriſt ſhal appeare in the ſpirit to his, conforming them to himſelf in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which wil appear ſeven times more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, than formerly when we knew him after the fleſh. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. <hi>He that is weak and feeble amongst them, ſhal be as David;</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt; David</hi> ſhal be as God, even as the Angels of God before him: This is the glorious conformity that all the Saints ſhal have unto Jeſus Chriſt in the ſpirit, &amp; this glorious unity and conformity unto the Law of Righteouſneſſe is that wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the firſt ſight of it very terrible and dreadful to the ſons of men. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Who is She that looketh forth as the morning,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169419:50"/> faire at the Moon, cleare as the Sun, terrible as an Army with Banners:</hi> ſuch wil bee the ſtrangeneſſe of this glorious truth, that it wil not only appear terrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the men of this world, but even Chriſt ſets it forth himſelf with a note of admiration, not as if it were ſtrange to him, but rather to diſcover her excellent glory; and (indeed) the Church will bee worth a looking on, &amp; her glory a ſeeking-after, of all ſpiritual ones.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Particular propounded for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the truth in hand, is; that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is wholly ſpiritual, and not of this world, that as formerly, ſo in the latter dayes, the glory of his Kingdom ſhal be in the ſpirit, and not in the fleſh; it wil be ſpiritual, and not perſonal: for clearing of it, I ſhal firſt prove it from teſtimony of Scripture. 2ly. By ſpiritual Arguments grounded upon Scripture. 3ly Anſwer ſuch Queſtions and Scripture-grounds, which ſeeme to hold it forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 By teſtimony from Scripture, it is the word of Chriſt himſelf. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world;</hi> that is, not a fleſhly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Kingdome over the bodies of men; but a ſpiritual and internal one; <hi>the kingdom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169419:50"/> of heaven is within you:</hi> So likewiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. There is no more knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh, they are too fleſhly thoughts for a ſpiritual Chriſtian. Secondly, it wil appear by ſpiritual Arguments like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Argument.</hi> The ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt with his Saints, is the moſt glorious preſence. Chriſt wil be moſt gloriouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his people in the latter dayes, <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> his preſence, and ſo his Kingdome, will be a ſpiritual preſence, and not a perſonal, The major Propoſition is evident from Scripture, that the ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt, is the moſt glorious preſence: This Chriſt tels his Diſciples when he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally with them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. <hi>Nevertheleſſe it is expedient that I go away, for if I goe not away, the Comforter wil not come unto you:</hi> And therefore, Chriſt tels his Diſciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>That if they loved him, they would not reaſon, becauſe he ſaid, he would goe away;</hi> becauſe his ſpiritual preſence was the moſt glorious preſence: and we ſee it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Diſciples of Chriſt were moſt ſpiritual, and had moſt ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, when Chriſt was gone from them in perſon, and they enjoyed him
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169419:51"/> in the ſpirit. That the preſence of Chriſt in the latter dayes will be moſt glorious; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by all that have been formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and I think none of light, deny it: then the concluſion holds true, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt with his people in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, wherein they ſhal enjoy moſt light and glory; wil be a ſpiritual preſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Argument.</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt be known of the Saints no more after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit; then his reigne in the latter dayes of the Goſpel wil not be perſonal, but ſpiritual: but, hee is no more to be knowne of the Saints after the fleſh, as you have formerly heard, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Therefore his preſence, and ſo his Kingdome will not bee a fleſhly or perſonal preſence and kingdome; but a ſpiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Arg.</hi> Spiritual glory, and ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, is that which moſt of all ſuites with the majeſty and glory of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 14 <hi>The glory of the Saints ſhall be ſpiritual, and their enjoyment ſpiritual in the latter dayes; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual knowledge, Eſa</hi> 11. <hi>and ſpiritual confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto Chriſt, Zach.</hi> 12.8. <hi>and ſpirituall joy and rejoycing, Iſa</hi> 35, 10. Ergo, <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Kingdome of Chriſt, in, and with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169419:51"/> his Saints, will be a ſpiritual Kingdome, and not a perſonal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Arg.</hi> Chriſts Kingdom and preſence ſhal bee with all his people, filling them with ſpiritual glory, <hi>Iſa</hi> 25.7. <hi>He will take away the veil ſpread over all Nations,</hi> &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>And they ſtall ſay, Loe, this is the Lord, wee have waited for him.</hi> Chriſts perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, very few Saints have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the litteral ſence: thoſe that have dyed for Chriſt, have dyed other deaths, &amp; not beheaded; therefore, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it in the letter, but in the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The fourth particular propounded, was, what was meant, in that the reſt of the dead were not raiſed, until the 1000. yeares were finiſhed; that is, none that had beene

As light

(Wait the Lords time, and it wil come on apace.) But firſt, we are yet like to be given into the hands of the little horn, who changes times &amp; lawes; the two witneſſes are yet like to be ſlain, &amp; to ſydead 3 dayes &amp; a half; and the woman cloathed with the Sun, to be driven into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for a little ſpace, a time, times, &amp; halfe a time; the Beaſt with two hornes like a Lambe, hath yet a little time to make uſe of his power; perſwading them that dwel in the Earth, to make an Image to the firſt Beaſt; and that none but thoſe who own it, ſhal buy or ſel with them: the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed under the Altar to wait a little time, before they be raiſed up to live with Chriſt 1000. years: but it is not long, the viſion is for an appointed time: in the end, it wil ſpeak, and not ly; it wil come, and not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The firſt 1000. is almoſt paſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third, are coming on apace; &amp; all

This is the firſt glorious work of the Lord Jeſus, in, and amongſt the Saints: the Lord reigneth, let the Saints rejoyce: the Lord reigneth, let the world tremble. See <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.5. The Lord our God wil come, and all the Saints with him; that is, Chriſt will come in the ſpirit, and all the Saints ſhall appear gloriouſly in him.</p>
                  <p>A word of Application: Firſt, if this bee truth, that the Kingdome of Chriſt is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual kingdome, &amp; not of this world; this may inform us how far, beſides the Goſpel
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169419:58"/> in the ſpirit and truth of it; thoſe men are, who make the Kingdome of Chriſt to bee meerly political and a ſtate Kingdom, who turne the world by a humane power into the Church and Kingdome of Chriſt (as they ſay) &amp; Chriſt muſt have a worldly carnal Kingdome, no better than the Kings of the earth enjoy; or elſe he ſhal have none at all: it ſavors exceedingly of the earth, &amp; ere long, thither it muſt return.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſhould incourage the Saints to preſſe forward after the knowledge of God in the ſpirit; that as the kingdome of Chriſt is ſpiritual, and not of this world; ſo may the Saints Kingdom likewiſe be in the ſpirit, and ſo all their enjoyments may be ſpiritual enjoyments: this is that will make the ſoule fat, and wel-liking in the Lord, fill the ſoule with joy &amp; peace, which the world is not acquainted with; their eyes never ſaw it, nor their hearts concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; neither are they like to ſee it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord make them ſpiritual.</p>

               <p n="1">1. If the name of Chriſtian wil ſerve, and yet live looſe and prophane; that they ſhall have, and there he wil hold them. If there muſt be a conformity to Chriſt, and a more zealous and conſcionable walking; to quiet the Conſcience, it ſhall have it: he will go as neere unto Chriſt with the ſoule as may be, provided it reſt it ſelfe below: and thus, Chriſt ſaith, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall come under this deluſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting life from duty, and it wil appear to be but workes of iniquity of ſin, (why) becauſe acted by the man of ſin, acted not from a right principle, nor by a right power, neither to a right end; acting there muſt be, but not Chriſt-acting. Hence it is, that though he wil be a Chriſtian, and ſo talkes much of Chriſt, yet; he denyes Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, that is in the fleſh of his Saints, the ſpirit of Chriſt acting and working all things in the Saints (and they are ſenſible of it) and thus this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable man of ſin carries on hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169419:64"/> to perdition many and many a ſoule, And now it is more wicked and deceivable, than when in its proper place, acting after the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.20.21. then every one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is ſencible of it. Hence it is, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. The uncleane ſpirit being caſt out, that is out in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane forme; it can no longer be owned: he is now content to come in, when it is ſwept and garniſhed, prophaneſſe and filthyneſſe is gone, and now he comes in a more refined forme, perhaps legall reformation, as the preſent Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees to whom Chriſt ſpake, or elſe the name of Chriſtian, or the knowledge of Chriſt, after the fleſh; but Chriſt ſaith, the latter end of the man thus deceived is ſeven times worſe than the begining: he comes in this refined forme with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worſe ſpirits than himſelfe, and ſo makes him ſeven times more, the Child of perdition than before. Oh then, how doth it concern every one bearing the name of Chriſtian to looke about them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they are not deceived and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with this Antichriſt under the name of Chriſt! ſeeing it is the high-way
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169419:64"/> of ſoules ruine, now in the dayes of the Goſpel; for herein doth Sathan declare himſelfe to be the Maſter of Arts in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelfe into the ſon of light, and under the name of Chriſt, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to ruine ſoules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is Antichriſt in the Hiſtory or in the Letter, and this flowes from Antichriſt in the Spirit: now the ſoule being poſſeſſed with Antichriſt, he growes up into ſome forme, and now not onely in the ſpirit inviſibly, but in the letter: more viſible he appeares ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſeate of God, and he may be deſcryed principally under theſe 3 heads, as ſitting in the ſeate of Chriſt, and acting thoſe things which properly belong to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In making Chriſtians by a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, it being the proper worke of God in Chriſt to make Chriſtians, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37.44. but now here is an Antichriſt will undertake the buſineſſe, and ſo turns the world into Chriſtians or rather An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians, and pretend that they do the worke of Chriſt too: when, if he did the worke of Chriſt, he would rather keep off all carnal ignorant ones, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169419:65"/> of none, until made willing and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual by Jeſus Chriſt; for Chriſt doth not onely owne ſoules, when they come; but firſt gives them a will to come, and that by a ſpiritual, and not a humane power. Hence it comes to paſſe, that there are ſo many carnal profane ones under the name of Chriſtian, becauſe made Chriſtian not by Jeſus Chriſt but by men.</p>
               <p>Oh that the Lord would be pleaſe to inlighten the underſtandings of theſe men betymes, that they might not walke in a way ſo directly oppoſite to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and deſtructive to their own &amp; milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſoules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In preſcribing rules of worſhip which is proper onely to Jeſus Chriſt to preſcribe rules, and to carry through the ſoule in acting according to theſe rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To preſcribe rules; this belongs unto Chriſt, and who ever undertakes it, puts themſelves in the roome of Chriſt, and is the Antichriſt: this is to exerciſe creature-wiſdome in the things of Jeſus Chriſt, and (indeed) to ſit in the ſeate of God. It is the worke of Chriſt in the Spirit to helpe; in prayer or any duty; we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169419:65"/> know not what we pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. It is Chriſt that helpeth both to ſee our wants, and formeth by his ſpirit, words within accordingly. Therefore thoſe who preſcribe formes and rules of worſhip, put themſelves in the roome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It belongs to Chriſt to give in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to act according to thoſe rules, but Antichriſt gives the command, and ſo carries on an external acting, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſt; but his own minde.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Antichriſt may be diſcovered as ſitting in the ſeate of God not onely 1. In making Chriſtians. 2. In preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing rules, but 3. In compelling all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe rules whatever Chriſt ſaith, that matters not; he himſelfe will be the Chriſt, and muſt be obeyed, let Chriſt ſay what he will, and all that queſtion his power muſt be the Antichriſt, for he exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God, or that is worſhiped; ſo that he, as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe that he is God, and in all theſe particulars there is a myſtery lyeth, a myſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169419:66"/> hid under the name and notion of Chriſt; therefore, ſo much the more to be dreaded. To be a Chriſtian, is accounted a gallant thing: and therfore, not only himſelf; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers likewiſe look upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to be a matter of much piety, to make men Chriſtians, and cauſe them to own Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Oh! but here lyes a myſtery of iniquity, many ſoules made Chriſtians by a humane power, are but Antichriſtians, and ſo under the name of Chriſtian, are likely to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever, if the Lord prevent it not: An excellent thing accounted in the world to make creatures Chriſtians, as ſoone as they are born, by ſprinkling a little water upon them, &amp; ſo in bearing them in hand, that they are ſo ever after: but here lyeth a myſtery of iniquity, &amp; one of the ſoule ruiningſt myſteries of iniquity as ever came from Hel: Speak <hi>England,</hi> ſpeake all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions called Chriſtian; whether (almoſt all people of all ſorts, devoutly ſlain in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under this myſtery of iniquity) to have formes of worſhips preſcribed, that all Prieſts and People may walk in one forme and way of worſhip, and all compelled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is accounted an excellent part of Chriſtianity? but here lyeth a myſtery of

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y under it. Firſt, it brings all ſorts of people to be acting in ſomething, though worſe than nothing, and ſo de ude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all their actings; it cauſeth them to look to men, and not to Chriſt Secondly, it cauſeth them to bleſſe themſelvs in their unity, in formes and worſhips, never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning their Oneneſſe with Chriſt in the Spirit, they are as ſtrangers unto it. Hence it is, that uniformity in the Letter, is ſo much called for amongſt all ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being wholly ignorant of unity in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>I could inſtance in divers other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as Miniſtry, Guifts, Church, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all have ſomething like Chriſt in them; but it is al but the number of a man, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane, carnal Miniſtry, humane guifts, and annointings in ſtead of the ſpirit, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church, invented Ordinances: but I paſſe it at preſent.</p>
